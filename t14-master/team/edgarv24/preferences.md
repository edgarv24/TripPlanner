1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text, email, slack are the best ways to reach me. I'm available mostly at any time.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I'm hoping our team can help each other learn to work together as well as learn the tools and the workflow of a successful team.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My personal goals are to be a dependable teammate in whichever role comes to me. As far as communication, I would like to be 
     available to help my team whenever I can, as well as learn how to be comfortable reaching out for help when I need it. 
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Pride. Thinking I can do it myself, or not wanting to sound dumb by asking something that seems obvious. Things like that
     will get in the way of connecting with my team and progressing towards accomplishing our assignments.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * We should always strive for the best possible quality of work that we can do. If others think they can't get an A, or want to produce B work,
     then maybe we should work towards helping turn the B work into an A. Realistically, there may be circumstances that result in less than A work,
     but striving for the best possibly quality of work under those circumstances should still apply.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * No, but perhaps it is acceptable for the team to help weaker teammates when they need help, in order to strengthen that person for future work.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * This is hard for me to gauge, but I'm anticipating on working at least an hour or two a day on incremental progress. At least the class website
     states that it will require 9 hours per week, which would line up with an hour or two a day. 
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Initially, we should talk and decide who is comfortable with what, or how we expect to work together. I think over time, roles will evolve or 
     solidify.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * We should let Dave know immediately instead of letting it fester. As well as let the person know that is not acceptable.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We need to communicate and accept each others criticism to reach a conclusion as to what the quality should be. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Honestly, I can't control other people, I can only control my own work habits. But in the spirit of my personal goals towards teamwork, 
     I will try to communicate if the team member's work habits are affecting the progress of the team as a whole.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * That would be great, if we can figure that out.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Not entirely sure. I think it really depends on how we work together. If everyone is comfortable working independently at some point,
     then meetings outside of class will probably dip. However, if we need to constantly be interacting, then maybe meetings go up. And
     additionally, if we prefer/enjoy to work together in person, then meetings may go up as well. 
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Ideally, yes. I, especially, don't want to make decisions on my own. I don't expect my word to be final, I like to discuss and gather thoughts
     before a major decision. Maybe if it is a small decision that will not have a major impact.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * There may be times when one person vehemently disagrees on something, so we need to either discuss and convince the one person why they should 
     agree, or that person needs to accept that we cannot make progress unless they go with the majority. That person also needs to make their case
     for their decision, because maybe if they spell it out clearly enough, it will convince the majority that their view is not for the best.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * It depends if that person is a natural leader, and if that person seems to be guiding us in the right direction. But we should strive for
     equality of opinion and decision making. 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * It depends on if I feel comfortable guiding us in the right direction. Becoming more of a leader is a personal goal of mine because I'm not
     very confident in that aspect. And for that reason, if I feel that these responsibilities are too much for me, then I will say so and express
     to my teammates that it is too much, or I will express those concerns to Dave or a TA for advice on what to do.
