# Preferences for _Darin Harter_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text and Slack messages will generally get the fastest response. E-mail can work for longer messages, but I only
   check it a few times per day at most. I am available most hours except during live classes at 10am MWF and 11am TR.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I hope my team will have fun and learn some valuable skills for the future. I expect that we should get assignments
   done on time without rushing to finish at the deadline.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I haven't worked on a semester long project with a team before, so my goal is to learn how to divide responsibilities
   and keep everyone on the same page. Also, I want to make sure no one is falling behind or feeling left out. I will try
   my best to be helpful and not get in the way of my teammates' success.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Time management and effort are common obstacles that could limit learning and success. The ability to overcome 
   technical problems without being able to frequently meet in person may also play a part.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I would reason with my team about it first to try to work it out. If the problem persisted, 
   I would just try my best to do my part and talk with the teacher/ TAs if my grade is being negatively effected by others.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * The workload should be balanced between all members so that everyone has a chance to learn and get a good grade.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * The course site says to expect 9 hours per week. It may take more or less depending on the sprint and what
   issues we run into.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We will have to look at the planning board to see what needs to be done, and then figure out who feels comfortable
   working on each part. It may be good to mix it up once in a while to allow everyone to develop new skills.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * The team should check in with that person to make sure everything is alright, then help them if they were struggling.
   If it keeps happening, the teachers may need to get involved to figure out a solution.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Since everyone is still learning, we should try to be more lenient than usual with the work teammates produce. If
   something could obviously be improved, we should offer tips or work with everyone to carry out a fix.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I will mostly just ensure that the project is progressing as expected, and motivate members to at least get their
   part done on time.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * If possible, this would be the best way to make solid progress and work out bugs. Since all of my classes are online,
   I won't be on campus unless the team needs to meet. I'd prefer not to do it too often since it takes 40 minutes to get
   to the library from my house. Also, I don't want to bring back covid to my family if there are a lot of cases on campus.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * It depends on how well the team functions over slack and online meetings.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * For big decisions, this might be best to avoid upsetting anyone. For smaller ones, one or two members would be fine. 
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Try to come up with a compromise, or help show why one argument will help the project more than the other.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * If it is becoming a problem, I might remind them that it is a group project and no single person should decide the process.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * If the responsibilities are more than I can handle, I would request assistance and try to get others more involved.
