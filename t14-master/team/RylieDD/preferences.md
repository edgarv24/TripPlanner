# Preferences for Rylie Denehan

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text, email, and slack are the easiest ways to reach me. I work from 8-4 during the week so I might be a little late with responding during those hours. However, I'm free on weekends and after 4 during the week.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect that we will learn how to work efficiently and communicate effectively as a group while learning new skills and tools. I also expect us to complete assignments with the goals of understanding the tools/processes and striving for a high caliber of work.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My goals are to be a reliable and helpful teammate, get better at asking questions even if I think they're stupid, get better at helping assign tasks, and get better at having confidence in my work.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I imagine that there will be obstacles with communicating and collaborating remotely. I will also probably have a little bit of difficulty learning new tools/skills quickly.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I think we will be able to talk to each other and encourage each other that we are capable of working together and getting an "A".
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I don't think some team members should do more work to make up for other team members. We should be helping each other while having a balanced workload.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I imagine an hour or 2 a day will allow for a successful project, but I'm definitely willing to put in more time.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We can meet as a group, find each other's strengths and weaknesses with tools/languages/skills, and work from there when assigning tasks.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * We can speak to the person and determine if there was a personal issue or event that prevented them from following through with the commitment and help them with the work or assignment. However, if this person continues to miss commitments, we can bring this up to the TAs or Dave.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We can talk as a group and listen to each other's thoughts. I think that we could reach a compromise that favors a higher quality of the work through discussion.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I will keep an open mind and be open with comminucating to my teammates. I understand that everyone has their own work habit that is successful to them. If a team member's work habit is detrimental to the team, we can talk to the member and try to find ways to help them work better.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I'm alright with having a standing meeting time online at any time outside of class as long as it's after 4 during the week. I also live in Colorado Springs but I can come up to Fort Collins on the weekend if the team wants to meet in person.  
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I think that we should meet outside of class at least twice a week to check in with each other and assess the project's progress. I'm also open to meeting up more frequently.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * I think we will need the approval of every team member before decisions are made since this is a group project and everyone should have a say in how this project will go.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * I think we can discuss as a team and reach a compromise if the rest of the team isn't able to convince the other team member.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * I will talk to my teammates and ask if they are experiencing this as well and then we will talk to the dominating teammate. If this becomes is a bigger issue, the TAs and Dave may have to be involved.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will talk to my teammates and ask for more help with assigning tasks and forming the team process.
