# Teamwork Questionnaire for cessna17
# Preferences for cessna17

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text, email, slack, and just about anything I try to get back to as quick as I can. My schedule is fairly all over the place, 
     but I can get back to anyone fairly quickly with any method (except calling, that one I'll have to respond to when I get some time)
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I'm hoping we will be able to gain a level of experience when it comes to working as a team in the development workplace that we haven't been exposed to in any
     other ComSci class. This will be the first time we get to work with other people to complete one cohesive project. 
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My personal goals are to be able to be a dependable and reliable teammate, but I also want to learn and have the ability to get help from the people on my team.
     I know I'm not the strongest coder or developer out there so I know I have lots to learn and I want to be able to learn from those with more experience & knowledge than me.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * When I don't know whats going on or what to do sometimes I'm afraid to ask for help, especially when I think the answer could be something really easy to people who have
     more experience in this than I do.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I feel like I should always strive for the best possible quality of work that I can do. I do know that it may require more work on my end to really bring my work up to the
     level that some of my peers are able to reach with greater ease, but I know I have the potential to produce that level of work. I think it really boils down to communication
     and really iterating the goals of the group while also working on things ahead of time to get group feedback on what you can do to fix or bring your work up from a average (B)
     standpoint to an above average (A) piece. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * No, but it is acceptable for the team to be there help weaker teammates when they are struggling to meet that standard of work. Spending this extra time also strengthens
     the group as a whole and will be able to continuously produce better and better work and they are able to build each other up. 
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I know with previous CS classes I would spend 10-15 hours outside of class in order to complete my projects so I'm gauging somewhere around that timeframe. It may be less
     for other members, but I know for me personally I take longer to complete the projects and I allow myself time to struggle and reach out for help. 
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We should talk and decide who is comfortable with what, what each others strong suits are, and how we expect to work together. As time goes on and we get comfortable with
     our team members I think it'll begin to flow more naturally as our project expands and new tasks arise. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Communication with that team member to see what's going on with their life and also beginning that communication with Dave. It could be that maybe that had some rough life
     stuff come up and will be back to 100% for the next commitment, but we want to start that conversation early so incase it is just a 'hitchhiker' or 'couch potato' we didn't
     let it fester and our instructions will have had an eye on it.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We need to open to comments and criticism about our individual work to reach a the desired quality. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I think that if everyone has a level of transparency and honesty with their own work habits then it pushes those who's habits are less than ideal to really start to step
     up when they see how other people are working. Also, just communication is very key in this just to keep tabs on where everyone is and being able to provide updates.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I think that'd be a good idea to normalize our standing as a team. 
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I think it'll depend really. Maybe as we are getting into it like once every other week or something around there would be kind of nice. Then as we get familiar we could
     lessen the frequency (if we wanna do our own thing and feel good about it) or increase it (if we like working together and are more productive that way).
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Yes. I don't want to move in a way that doesn't work for everyone else and if I'm very in the wrong when approaching a task or decision. 
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * If a single individual disagrees on something, so we need to have an open conversation as a team so that way that individual has a chance to stand for their own opinion
     and so we can figure out if the majority way is really the best way to proceed. There's also the possiblility that both parties were in the right/wrong and that there could
     be a better option that we don't see until we start talking our way through it.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Allow conversation that insights opportunity for every member to speak and voice an opinion instead of letting one person drive the group because it might seem easier.
     There should be an allowance for everyone to have opinions on how the group moves and responds to tasks and decisions. 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I know that I lack some of the skills and experience to drive a group in this environment and I'd be terrified of making the wrong move or allowing the group to move in
     in the wrong direction. I possess some leadership skills, but without that experience some members may have I wouldn't feel entirely comfortable if more of the facilitation
     responsibilities fell on me. Especially before I know what my teammembers strengths and weaknesses are, but maybe after we found our flow I'd be more comfortable if I had to
     take on the facilitation of our project.
