## Team Preferences 
### Communication
The clarity and punctuality of information shared on mediums such as Slack and Microsoft Teams is a major focal point for this team. Members of The Fourteeners are expected to freely share thoughts, ideas, and opinions through open and honest discussions. It is necessary to create an environment where all members’ inputs and contributions are valued in order to promote work efficiency and minimize conflicts. During consideration of key technical and design decisions, the entire team should be consulted with to determine the preferred method of progression. Conflicts in opinion should be met with a compromise that favors the success of the team and project. More than anything, members should hold realistic expectations for each other, encourage participation, and respect all contributions to team discussions.

### Quality and Excellence
Maintaining a high standard of quality and excellence is an important goal for this semester. This applies to code structure, GitHub reviews, sprint reports, feature planning, team discussions, and all other aspects of this project. Our team values putting forward the best effort possible to meet deadlines and accomplish goals. In practice, this means starting the planning process early and keeping members accountable for their responsibilities and actions. We will accept criticisms, be lenient of setbacks, and reach effective compromises. During the development process, we will utilize the principles described in Clean Code that promote maintainability, flexibility, and readability. Avoiding procrastination and following these guidelines will help ensure there is no mess to clean up later.

### Responsibility
Members are expected to follow through on their responsibilities. There will be obstacles along the way such as managing time, communicating remotely, and shying away from help, but these can be overcome by working as a team. Everyone is responsible for being a reliable teammate, producing quality work, attempting to understand the system and tools, and helping those who are struggling. It is essential that individuals bring up their progress impediments during meetings so the team can jump in and help. A contribution of one to two quality work hours per day is expected from each member during sprints. While this is a formal learning project, The Fourteeners will strive to not take things too seriously, celebrate successes, and have fun!

### Diversity and Inclusion
Across the individuals in this team, there are a wide variety of skills, strengths, and preferences. Effectively combining these unique backgrounds and ways of thinking will lead to efficient problem solving and enhanced results. Teammates must reach out for help when they need it, and share relevant knowledge when requested. Everyone is constantly seeking to improve, so mistakes should be tolerated, learning should be embraced, and there should be flexibility in roles and assignments.

### Conflict Management
A sign of a good team is one that focuses on challenges and constructive criticism over blame and disagreement. The Fourteeners will strive to create a low risk and low pressure environment by showing patience and not pointing fingers following a mistake. If expectations are not being met, such as members missing deadlines or not producing “A” quality work, then the team will attempt to resolve the issue immediately through meeting. Repetitive and persistent issues will be brought up with Dave or the TAs for further guidance.

### Leadership
Strong leadership throughout the team will keep us on track with our visions and goals. No single person should dominate leadership roles or the workload, unless it is agreed upon by the team. Responsibilities and tasks will be evenly distributed across members to avoid negatively impacting grades and learning opportunities. Everyone will strive to follow through on commitments, model good behaviors, and be open to feedback. These rules will ensure efficient and effective progress while minimizing internal conflict.
